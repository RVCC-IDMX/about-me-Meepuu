# Marc Bonilla
> The porpose of this project is to show what ive learned in WD1 and have put to use in this project.
I went from feeling extremely lost to okay with html/css, I even hate css a little less now. I didnt think I'd be okay with looking at this now and being like wow I actually get this but this course really made me learn that it can be approached any way possible and you'll still come out with a wrinkle freshly grown in your brain, knowledge one would call it. 




# COLOR SCHEMES 
## I used [Mikael's Berglund's calming lake color scheme](https://color.adobe.com/calming-lake-color-theme-10694197/edit/?copy=true)
I stuck with using the red, cream, and darkish gray.

- ![D7443F](https://via.placeholder.com/15/D7443F/000000?text=+) `D7443F`
- ![F1ECE9](https://via.placeholder.com/15/F1ECE9/000000?text=+) `F1ECE9`
- ![485058](https://via.placeholder.com/15/485058/000000?text=+) `485058`

## These 3 were the main colors used in my about me.

The first color which is 1st in the example, was used for borders and text color.

The second color was used for the hover in the nav and odds for bio/hobbies.

The third color was used for the whole thing, the whole body

## Two more colors were also added to the mix which were

- ![333A42](https://via.placeholder.com/15/333A42/000000?text=+) `333A42`

- ![A6A5A1](https://via.placeholder.com/15/A6A5A1/000000?text=+) `A6A5A1`

> These two were used once or twice, first color was for the nav and footer, while the second color was for the favicon "TI" part.



# SOURCES 

For fonts, I used Birthstone and Open sans.
Birthstone was used for Headers  

Open Sans was used for normal text/body text.

Permanent Marker by Font Diner was also used for my favicon.
