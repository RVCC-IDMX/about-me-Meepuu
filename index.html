            <div>
              <p>Hello! I dont have a big biography but Im 23 and Im just an average college student, well I dont say average since Ive thrown away many semesters out of depression, so I'd say below average.</p>
              <p>In these pages, youll find small tidbits about me and some other things that I decided to throw inhere, once again Im just an average person who tends to do very little but a lot at the same time.</p>

        <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://streamable.com/x415zk"> My main hobby is Final Fantasty XIV, Im a semi-hardcore high end raider and overall game enjoyer. I've cleared uwu (Ultimate Weapon's Refrain) and TEA (The Epic of Alexander) along with Eden's Promise Savage, Im looking forward to Pandeamonium's raid tier. </a></li>
            <li>I read a lot of manga when Im not doing anything on FFXIV or at work, so far Im reading My Hero Academia, Jujustu Kaisen, Rent a Girlfriend, Dandadan, Tokyo Revengers, and Mushoku Tensei. My all time favorite Manga is Haikyuu!!</li>
            <li>My favorite genre of games is story/single player games, Ive enjoyed Undertale, Bioshock, NieR Automata/Replicant, Yakuza, Oneshot, Breath of the Wild, Assassins Creed 2, and the list goes on.  </li>
            <li>One of the main reasons why I love raiding in FFXIV is I get to learn something new when new raids come out, its a huge puzzle to figure out while doing your damage rotation ontop of using your brain, its just something new to tackle, I love learning new things even if it drives me nuts in the end.</li>
            <li>This ties with the hobby at the top, I like to try and theorycraft very dumb things or something that my thought process would be applied to, its my favorite thing saying a dumb idea and others thinking he might be onto something. </li>

        <h2>CSS Animation</h2>

        <div>
            <p>Ive choosen CSS Animations because it allows animations with keyframes without using JS or RIP, Flash.</p>
            <p>It has 10 properties you can use, @keyframes, animation, animation-delay, animation-duration, animation-direction, animation-fill-mode, animation-iteration-count, animation-name, animation-playstate, animation-timing-function.</p>
            <p>You can do a bunch of things with this, you can have a fun little minigame using the animation on your page, show a small animation you've made with it, or use it to showcase some crazy stuff you've come up with and are now showing others.</p>
            <p>in the case you have some really high animations or loops, the cpu usage is going to be really heavy on your pc, so when doing said things make sure whatever you're adding to the page doesnt take a load from your pc or is really strainous to run because theres a chance your client or targetted party's PC might not be able to keep up. </p>
            <p>You've probably used aniamtion somewhere in a project for webdev and havent even noticed it, the place that it probably was used was in the Nav Bar making because if you hover over my nav bar, it has a small animation at the top of it and the hover turns my text white instead of red.</p>
            <p>I think its super neat that you can do this without having to be dependant on JS or again, RIP FLASH. Its usage all comes from how you make it work in css, the usage is unlimited or well limited until your PC explodes.</p>
